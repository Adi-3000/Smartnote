## ✨ Modern Capabilities

### 🤖 Agentic AI Integration
Powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite**, your assistant is now a proactive agent.
- **Autonomous Action**: Ask it to "Tag all notes" or "Create a folder and move related notes," and it performs the JSON commands directly.
- **Smart Auto-Titling**: Untitled notes are automatically named based on their content after a 3-second pause in typing.
- **Context Awareness**: The AI remembers your notes and folder structure for better organization.

### ✅ Integrated Task Management
- **Interactive Checklists**: Add clickable checkboxes directly inside your rich text notes.
- **Global Task Board**: A dedicated view that scans all notes and gathers every checkbox into one master to-do list.

### 🚀 Performance & Connectivity
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Install SmartNotes as a native desktop or mobile app. Works offline!
- **Google Drive Sync**: Secure, hourly auto-backups to your personal Drive.
- **Tag Library**: Automatic hashtag discovery creates a dynamic sidebar for instant filtering.

### 🎨 Premium Aesthetics
- **Glassmorphism Design**: A sleek, dark/light mode interface with smooth animations.
- **Live Preview Cards**: Note cards in the grid view render your actual HTML styles and smart content previews.
